# Utilizing Data-Driven Techniques to Improve First-Year Engineering Courses: Using Prediction, Clustering, and Diagnostic Models in Engineering Education
## Project Description
This project aims to improve the first-year engineering courses by utilizing data-driven techniques. The project uses prediction, clustering, and diagnostic models to analyze the data collected from ENGR 100 and identify patterns and trends among the students. The identified patterns and trends can be used to improve the course and provide students with a positive learning experience.
